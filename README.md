# Mapping_Earthquakes Challenge

Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to update the original earthquake map created by adding Tectonic Plate Data, Major Earthquake Data and Additional third Map. This will enable Basil and Sadhana see earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth and earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. They will also be able to see the data on the third map which is created in this analysis. Other tools used for this analysis include Javascript, Leaflet.js and geoJSON data.

Result
